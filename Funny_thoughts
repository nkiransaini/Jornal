The thought is that I was focus and I am playing the India most important final match. I was not go position but I gather the energy 
I became so focused that I can read the ball like snake can read it's pray's moment. and my pery was ball, I had to hit no matter what. 
As ball come it my bat I attact it like snake did, Sanke which was hungery for so many days, It's the last chance of it survival. By the god grace the pery comes to 
the preadtors mouth, like already surrender to it. and...
tackkk..
yeahhhhhhhh...
Whole stadium start clapping and cheering, like crowd become mad. But the ball with it full speed cutting all the sounds, going to traget 
target. like batsman set a traget and misslie is going to hit, nothing can stopped .
And hum bo match jeet gaye... :)
