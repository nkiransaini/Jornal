Actionable Steps to Change Your Behavior & Embody Your Authentic Self:
1. Create a Non-Negotiable Morning Ritual
Wake up, stretch, drink water. No phone for the first 30 minutes.
Do 5 minutes of any physical movement (push-ups, squats, or running).
Set an intent for the day: "What one thing will I commit to today?"
2. Build Emotional Awareness & Delay Gratification
When you reach for your phone or fantasize, pause and ask yourself:
“What am I avoiding right now?”
Instead of quitting when it gets hard, acknowledge the discomfort and push through for 5 more minutes.
3. Use the "No Zero Days" Rule
Even if you don’t feel like exercising, do one push-up.
Even if you don’t feel like writing, write one sentence.
Even if you don’t feel like working toward your career, take one tiny action.
Something is always better than nothing.
4. Channel Your Hero Mindset into Small, Real-World Wins
You dream of being a soldier—so train like one, even in small ways.
You dream of being a writer—so write for 10 minutes every day, no excuses.
You dream of being an investor—so start learning about finance and small investments today.
